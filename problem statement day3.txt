	# finance stock market: 

	# you are a stock analyst: 

		# you want to build a correlation strategy for banking stock:

		# you got to know that some bank stocks behave in the same way:		   

		# ICICI and SBI bank: are significantly correlated or not?

		# with correlation: item 1 price will increase and item 2 price
			# will also increase: then both items are positively correlated.

		# argument side you can say something but quantification is a tedious task: 

		# very very simplied method: simple linear regression: basics....

		
		# if sbi stock will crease by 2%, how much will icici stock should increase?


		# data on sbi stock and icici stock:
			# yahoo finance: daily price change series: 

			# stock market remains open for mon-fri.... mon to friday daily stock prices
			# one year: 25 march 2022 to 24th mar 2023

		# some statisticians came up: 
					# argued that: can we also predict categorical y items: 
	

					# whether one horse will win the game or not?  (win, loss)
					# whether today rain will happen or not?		(rain, no rain)
					# whether india will win cricket match or not  (win, loss, draw)
	
					# if you have some body symbtomps: 
						# basaed on those symptoms, which of the following deasease you may have: 
								# (fever, cold, cancer)

		# how you will assign predicting probability of these categories??
		# win: 1, loss 0: 

				# linear regression model: -inf, +inf

		

				# based on some check ups: good or bad
				# high low: 
		
# where y is categorical value: 

			# we need to predict ethier that category or probability of happening that category???
