	# Supervised learning models: when y is known
				# Regression bases approach
				# Classification based approach

				# Decision tree and Random forest based models: 
							# basic regressiona and classification models as input as weak models: 
							# strong/super model 
				# bagging and boosting: 

				# sklearn library: 

	# Y is unknown/hidden in data: 

	# Unsupervised Machine Learning: 
				# Kmeans clustering is an unsupervised machine learning model: 

	# 3 more models (Clustering ML): 

			# Group of items/objects similar in nature or shows similar patterns.
					# cluster will be group defined: 



					# Banking: 
							# classify customers as 3 risk types: 
									# low risk profile 
									# medium risk profile
									# high risk profile

							# stocks in stock market: 
									# colors to stock types:

											# Low risk: blue color icon
											# Medium risk: yellow color
											# brown color: high risk 

							# SEBI: Security exchange board of India: 
	# Classification: 
					# x1,x2,x3,x4 ============ y (categorical: caterogies are given in example data: 
														# categories were known to us: 
														# flower: which category of flower it is?
														# 3 categories: 
														# Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica

	# sometimes, we are not sure or y column is hidden or not known to us: 
					# 

	# amazon: selling some product (digital product)

	# amazon is trying to identify some mapping or products which are sold together?

	# mobile --- cases/temper/earphone/headset/extended warranty

	# netflix: recommend web series or movies to its users as per watch history

	# for this type of problem: 
				# y value is not available in your dataset: 
				# task to machine learning to find y value as groups or categories or clusters: 

	# Clustering: 
				# once you are able to identify the y value as classes or groups in your historical data: 
	

	# y as categories and then you can use it to perform classification problems: 

	# with the help of Clustering: 
				# we were able to identify: which customer belong to which risk profile: 
				# y value is available with the help of clustering: 

				# some more predictions: 

	# i want to find out quality cluster of apple sold and price charged: 

		# how many types of qualities are available in market: 
		# how many price ranges are for those qualities: 

			# x and y axis: 

				# x axis : quantity sold
				# y axis: price of apple


	# Clustering types: 

		1. Partitioning Clustering: models: Kmeans clustering

				# divide the data into non hierarchical groups: 
				
				# in first step: divide dataset into a set of random k groups. 

						@ initialise k value as 2: 


				# (real k is hidden in starting, later we find optimum k value)

				# to find out optimum k value: 

					method1: we can do visual inspection: and we find out optimum k value:

				     method2: we apply machine learning clustering model: will give us optimum k value for the dataset:  	


				# we find out optimum number of k clusters based on distance matrix/formula: 


				# 8th standard or 9th standard: 

					# point a to point b: 
							# distance method: 

					# google map: use the same formual to calculate distance
					# uber: to calculate expected time based on distance
								$ manhattan distance formula

					# airplane: 
								# euclidean formula (k means)
								

		2. Density based clustering: 
		3. Distribution model based clustering: 

					# create data level distribution or some initial patterns to find out groups/clusters
					# normal distribution based gaussian distribution (GMM)

		4. ALTERNATIVE TO Partitioning clustering: 
					# Hierarchical Clustering: 

								# end nodes, clusters : Dendrogram based model clustering

		5. Fuzzy Clustering: kmeans fuzzy algorithm




# we will be applying partitioning based clustering: 

			# with the help of Kmeans Clustering approach

	# some basic data: about customers of mall: 
			
			# customer types or customer clusters: 

			# Genre (Sex) 
			# Age
			# Annual income
			# Spending score

		@ we want to create optimum groups of customers, 

		# based on which, if i will get a new customer information on genre, age, annual income, spending score: 

		# assign this customer to a group/cluster: 

	# customer group is unknown: y is unknown/hidden in data

	# Y is unknown: this type of problem is called: Unsupervised Machine Learning: 


	# we want to find out customer groups in dataset (y)

	# Genre (Sex) 
			# Age
			# Annual income
			# Spending score

	# follow mathematics to perform kmeans: 

			# we are going to check what value of K (1 to 20), can be optimum based on some iteration done with the help of mathematical formula:

	# i want to define a method, which will iteratively check, what can be optimum k(cluster) value in our dataset

	# i will be using two columsn to find a cluster: 

		# annual income and spending score to find customer cluster: 

		#
